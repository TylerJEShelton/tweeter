# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.

This project was edited and completed by [Tyler Shelton](https://github.com/TylerJEShelton) as part of the Flex Web Development Program through [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/).  This project was meant to teach front-end development by creating and implementing a responsive web design.
